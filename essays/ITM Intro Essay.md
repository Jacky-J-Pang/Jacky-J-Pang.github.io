**Why MIS?**

August 29, 2021

My name Jacky. This is my third year at UH Manoa, currently studying applying for a triple major in MIS Business.

I have always been interested in writing my own code; however, due to what I have experience with coding during high school I find the somewhat stressful. Due to that I decided to lay low with coding and programming for a while. Now that a few years has passed since I did a coding, I decided to enroll in the MIS class, to take on the challenges of coding once more. I have been told that MIS is just not limited to just coding programs or researching data, but something a lot more in depth when taking this class.  I have been warned by many of my peers that taking this class is not all walk in the park but rather sometimes stressful sometimes awarding depending on how fast you could comprehend to understand the project. 

Regardless, I took this course to help better understand both the front and back end of web developing and its related fields.
