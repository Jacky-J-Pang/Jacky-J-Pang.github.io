Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details?

Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.

Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?

Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

The wod for this week's assignment is to create a simple invoice statemnet to give to the client. I have reviewed codes in lab  format appply familarize yourself in var 
steatements or variable types. Review the video when I am stuck, since I got confused during the invoice portion of the assignement where you need to the set up a table format for 
a invoice. I haven't follow the video and decided to create my own table, which of course took alot longer hant the alloted estimated time. In all honestly evyerthing works well, 
up to the point of the table variables set are straight forward, in other words you just define a variable through the use of simple math to compute basic invoice statmenet.
I am not sure what I can do better until my next WOD besides reading all ht einstruction clearly and format myself in the best chronological order in inputing code to address the 
objective of the excercise to save a bit mroe time.
